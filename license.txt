WUHU LICENSE

(also known as "The reason you are reading this is because
you don't have your priorities right"-file.)

1. Wuhu comes with no obligations from the side of its creators.
   We won't add features unless they're a really good idea, even
   if your party's success depends on it. (Because it doesn't.)
   
2. The creators of Wuhu take no responsibility over any damage
   you cause with it. (Yes, you.)
   In other words, if your party sucks, you might want to look
   somewhere else for blame.
   
3. Wuhu is free, as in beer. We don't ask for free entrance to
   parties that use Wuhu, nor any compensation, nothing.
   It would be nice, however, if you could notify us about the
   use of our stuff.
   
4. Please don't make mutated versions of it, and/or if you have
   something you hacked in and it doesn't smell too bad of
   WTF, contact us and we'll try to integrate it with credits included.
   
5. Wuhu remains our copyright. Just so you know.
